Creators need to think long-term now instead of chasing quick viral moments. â€” Industry Expert Sarah Martinez <p>The platform&#x27;s data shows that creators with higher engagement rates and community interaction are being rewarded with increased visibility and better monetization opportunities.</p> <h2>Looking Forward</h2> <p>The platform&#x27;s commitment to rewarding quality content over viral moments represents a maturation of the creator economy that could benefit serious content creators in the long run.</p> <p>This shift aligns with broader industry trends toward sustainable creator businesses rather than flash-in-the-pan viral success.</p>",
